# react-native-ios-app-clips

> Adding iOS 14 App Clips to ReactNative apps.

![Hero App Clips from Apple - https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/](https://github.com/monterail/react-native-ios-app-clips/raw/master/docs/hero.png)

**This library is under heavy development!**

## Description

You can run project `ReactNativeAppClips` and run `ReactNativeAppClip` seperately, but you can't setup Apple App Clips Experience (Dialogs with CTAs).
We are still waiting on Apple, to test it on TestFlight: https://developer.apple.com/news/releases/?id=07072020h (now App Clips are **unsupported**).

## TODO

- [ ] Refactor to library version (based on Bob - https://github.com/react-native-community/bob)
- [ ] Add step by step installation instruction with screenshoots if needed
- [ ] Implement App Clips Experience (after Apple give us opportunity ;) to add it to TestFlight)
- [ ] Add CTAs support in `ReactNativeAppClip`, get UIUserActivity after click on CTA in AppClip Monit

## Installation

[WIP]
